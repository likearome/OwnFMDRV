; this is a copy of the _chain_intr() function, borrowed as-is from the
; source code of OpenWatcom 1.9 (bld/clib/intel/a/chint086.asm). I only
; changed the name of the procedure to _mvchain_intr() to avoid confusion.
; the reason I'm doing this is to have it inside my own code segment, so I
; can use it from within the TSR after dropping all libc
